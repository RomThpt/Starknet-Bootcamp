# Basecamp 11 App
I'm following the Starknet BootCamp 11

## Dev Environment
To activate the dev environment, make sure to have Docker and VSCode installed on your system. On VSCode, make sure to install the Dev Containers extension to make use of this Docker image for Starknet development.

To launch an instance fo VSCode inside the container, go to View -> Command Palette and execute the command Dev Containers: Rebuild and Reopen in Container. At this point you should have an instance of VSCode with access to all required binaries (Scarb, Foundry, Starkli, etc.) on the integrated terminal and syntax highlighter for Cairo and Toml files.
